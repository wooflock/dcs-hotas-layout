# dcs-hotas-layout
An app that takes your DCS joystic and throttle settings, and creates a picture and button layout of your stick and throttle.

If you ever wanted to easily create a button mapping picture for your joystick and thrust controller for reference
this is the tool for you.

A small app that takes your (or someone elses) Digital Combat Flight Simulator (DCS) settings files
and displays the settings on your flightstick. You can create a PDF for later reference.

It is built with a template system so it can support multiple sticks.
Right now i have only added the Logitech X-56. But it is quite straight forward
to add another stick as well.

Your config files for your stick reside in:
C:\Users\<your username>\Saved Games\ DCS\Config\Input\<aircraft>\joystick\
